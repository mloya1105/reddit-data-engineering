1. initialize new python project
4. create file structure using terminal
        mkdir config dags data etls logs pipelines tests utils
3. create .gitignore and be sure to include:
        venv 
        *.conf
        logs
        .idea
        __pycache__
4. create new repository and push current changes
5. using terminal, create files to set up docker environment & install packages
        touch airflow.env docker-compose.yaml Dockerfile
6. all info in airflow.env, docker-compose.yaml and Dockerfile copy/pasted from AirScholar's github

7. Youtube video says to do command pip freeze > requirements.txt 
        This did NOT work for me! For some reason, it included some filepaths that caused the build to fail on my end.
        The command that worked was 
            pip3 list --format=freeze > requirements.txt
8. Now, execute the build by running
            docker compose up -d --build  
9. Ensure build is successfull by checking Docker Desktop app and checking your containers running under the appropriate source
